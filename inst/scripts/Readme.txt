The files in this folder are example input files to run the demo in the vignette.

example1_features.txt is a tab-demilited file with features as columns and samples as rows. A non-demo form of this file would be
any multi'omic profile (metagenomic, metatrascriptomic, metaproteomic, or metabolomic). A metagenomic file could be a taxonomic profile
with species as rows and samples as columns with the data points being relative abundances.

example1_metadata.txt is a tab-delimited file with samples as rows and metadata as columns. The reverse of samples as columns and metadata 
as rows is also allowed as input. The data points can be numeric or characters. A non-demo form of this file would be metadata for the
samples of age, gender, and disease.
